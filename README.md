### Hi there 👋
I usually do most of the work on GitLab and Bitbucket, but I do my best to take at least a small part in the open source world on GitHub.

I'm a digital nomad since January 2019. What the heck is a digital nomad? Well... I talked about it in https://digitache.nerdthetravel.com, but long story short I didn't have time to travel and I almost never went on vacation because my job was absorbing me. So I ended up traveling and working full remote, this way all my free time is vacation time! 😎
